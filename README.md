 ## About
 Watch-o-licious is a web application that utilizes the TVMaze API. This was a project given a random target audience and API. I was given 'foodies' for an audience and the TVMaze API. I narrowed down my audience to those interested in all things pastries. Users are able to browse tv shows, and click on the shows to get more information on seasons and episodes. Users can favorite, mark as watched and mark on watch list episodes, they can also unfavorite, unwatch, and unwatchlist episodes. If the user navigates to the 'Favorites', 'Watched' or 'Watch List' pages, they will only see the episodes they have marked that correspond with the page they are on. Watch-o-licious was a colo project that took 6 days to build and test.
